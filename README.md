# Enhancing Sports Action Recognition With Temporal Saliency and Squeeze-Excitation Networks

## Overview

This repository contains the official implementation of the research paper:

**Enhancing Sports Action Recognition With Temporal Saliency and Squeeze-Excitation Networks**

The proposed framework integrates:

- Temporal Saliency Extraction
- Optical Flow-Based Motion Analysis
- Squeeze-and-Excitation (SE) Networks
- Inception-V3 Deep Learning Architecture

for accurate sports action recognition from video sequences.

The framework focuses on identifying the most informative temporal regions within sports videos and enhancing feature representations through channel attention mechanisms.

The following preprocessing steps are performed:

### 1. Frame Extraction

- Uniform frame sampling
- 16 frames extracted per video

### 2. Normalization

```python
frame = frame.astype(np.float32) / 255.0
```

### 3. Frame Resizing

```python
299 × 299
```

### 4. Median Filtering

```python
cv2.medianBlur(frame, 3)
```

### 5. Temporal Saliency Extraction

- Optical Flow Computation
- Motion Saliency Map Generation
- Saliency-Based Feature Enhancement
